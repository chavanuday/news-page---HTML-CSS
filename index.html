          <h2>Raining Season has started</h2>
          <p>
            The Indian Meteorological Department has predicted more rainfall in
            the state as well as temporary traffic congestion, slippery roads,
            and water-logging. IMD also warned that several Odisha districts are
            likely to experience enhanced rainfall activities in the next four
            to five days, and a low-pressure area is expected to form over the
            same region during the next two to three days due to the formation
            of a cyclonic circulation over the northwest Bay of Bengal.

          <p>
            Speaking of previous years' water cuts in the financial capital, in
            2022, BMC had imposed 10 percent water cut in June and July as the
            water stock in the city reduced below 10 percent. Prior to that in
            2020, 20 percent cuts were imposed in the month of August due to
            poor rains.
